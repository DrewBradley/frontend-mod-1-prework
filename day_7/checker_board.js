/*
psuedocode:
Create function that takes in two arguments, length (x), and width (y).
For every row (with an even index) print the pattern of 'X_' for every other row print '_X'.
The number of 'X_' or '_X' printed are determined by the value of 'y'.
Divide the value of 'y' by two, since characters are two digits long.
